Monolith Architecture

Monolith architecture is a traditional way of building software where all components of the application are combined into a single, unified codebase and deployed as one unit.


Microservice Architecture

Microservice architecture is a modern approach to building software where an application is divided into multiple small, independent services. Each service is responsible for a specific feature or functionality and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. These services communicate with each other through APIs (usually HTTP/REST or messaging queues).

1.	Development Speed
	•	Microservices: Faster development due to independent teams working on different services simultaneously.
	•	Monolith: Slower, as changes in one part can affect the whole application.
2.	Scalability
	•	Microservices: Easier to scale — you can scale only the services that need more resources.
	•	Monolith: Scaling requires deploying the entire application, even if only one part needs more resources.
3.	Deployment
	•	Monolith: Entire project is deployed as a single unit.
	•	Microservices: Each component (e.g., frontend, backend, payment service) is deployed separately.
4.	Change Management
	•	Monolith: A small change (e.g., one line in the frontend) requires redeploying the entire project.
	•	Microservices: Only the affected service (e.g., frontend) needs redeployment.
5.	Technology Stack
	•	Monolith: Usually limited to one main stack for the whole application.
	•	Microservices: Can use different stacks for different services (e.g., Python for ML service, React for frontend, Node.js for backend).
6.	Infrastructure Cost
	•	Monolith: Generally cheaper to host initially since it’s one deployment.
	•	Microservices: Can be costlier due to multiple services needing separate infrastructure, but more efficient in scaling.
7.	Maintenance & Updates
	•	Microservices: Easier to maintain and revamp specific parts without affecting the whole system.
	•	Monolith: Harder to update without risking breaking other parts of the application.

in conclusion monolith can be used for small application and if you need to build a larger project 
then we use microservices
or initially we can start with few microservices 2 or 3 and later as grows we can divide into more no of microservices to handle efficiently

in devtinder we will building 2 microservices - frontend and backend
the communicate using api calls
