if planning is good writting code is easy

LLD - low level design
    DB design 
        think about collections, documents and list it
        we will have the following collections
        user collection - to store user data
        connectionRequest - store connection data
            here we will store who sends the request to whom and the status of request
            fromUserId
            toUserid
            status - we can have pending, accepted, rejected, ignored,
    API documentation - which all APIs we will use


API Design
http methods - 
    get - to get data
    post - to send data
    put - to update data - Replaces the entire resource with the new data you send.
    patch - to update data - Updates only specific fields in the resource.
    delete - to delete data
/signup - post
/login - post
/profile - post (creating)
/profile - get (reading)
/profile - patch (updating)
/profile - delete (deleting). these are known as CRUD operations - create, read, update, delete
/sendRequest - post 
/acceptRequest - post
/request - get
/connection - get

find the all the corner cases and solve it if we doesnt solve it, then it might be a threat for us
